LPG® endermologie® is patented, and proprietary technique of cellular stimulation through reproducible
mechanical massage. It is 100% natural and effective, and targets the connective tissues of the body and
face, including skin, muscle, blood and lymphatic circulation. This mechanical massage technique
provides a deep tissue mobilization within the Cellu M6® treatment head, with beauty, wellness,
rehabilitation, sports and aesthetic medicine applications. LPG® techniques are non-aggressive and non-
invasive, with no downtime and no known side effects.

LPG® is the pioneer of advanced and patented technologies for the human body. endermologie® was the
first technology worldwide to gain FDA clearance for the treatment of Cellulite. For over 30 years, LPG®
has been developing non-invasive technologies for both natural beauty as well as advanced therapeutic
treatments. The benefits of LPG® techniques have also been proven by over 145 reputable scientific
studies.

 <span id="text">
 <h1> How does it work? </h1>
 Thanks to the different settings of the patented treatment head, LPG endermologie® helps to activate the
body’s elimination functions and stimulates the circulation (x3) while also relieving the symptoms of water
retention. After the 1st session, there is an immediate feeling of well-being. The ankles are refined, the
legs feel lighter and quickly regain their proper shape.

Symptoms such as heavy and painful legs or swollen feet and ankles are the result of poor blood and
lymphatic circulation. Toxins build up in the organism, which explains such volume fluctuations over the

course of a single day or throughout a woman’s cycle. What are the factors? Prolonged standing or
sitting, a sodium-rich diet, overly tight clothing, or even high temperatures can disturb the proper
functioning of the circulatory system

      <button id="accordion-button-1" aria-expanded="false"><span class="accordion-title">WHAT ARE THE CONTRAINDICATIONS?</span><span class="icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>Strict contraindications to the endermologie® include:</p>
<p>– Cancer in progression</p>
<p>– Infection or skin rash</p>
<p>– Disease with inflammatory eruption</p>
<p>– Anticoagulant treatment</p>
<p>– Blood disease</p>
<p>– Organ transplants (kidney, liver, etc.)</p>
<p>– Kidney failure</p>
<p>People with hypothyroidism, diabetes, or undergoing a long-term corticosteroid treatment respond less
well to our treatments. In case of doubt, please consult your general practitioner or your attending
physician.</p>

      <button id="accordion-button-2" aria-expanded="false"><span class="accordion-title">HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE TO SEE THE FIRST RESULTS?</span><span class="icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>From the very first sessions, your skin is brought back to life! Your skin texture is refined and your skin
more supple and radiant thanks to the reactivation of the production of collagen, elastin, and hyaluronic
acid. The results then keep improving after each session. For quicker results, sessions can be scheduled
several times a week at the beginning of the treatment (the fibroblast can be constantly stimulated). The
first month is important to trigger the process at the skin level. After that, one session per month is
enough. A beauty anti-aging lifestyle to be adopted all year round!</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="accordion-item">
      <button id="accordion-button-3" aria-expanded="false"><span class="accordion-title">WILL THE RESULTS LAST?</span><span class="icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>The best way to answer this question is with a metaphor: exercising two weeks during your summer
vacation won’t keep you fit for the rest of the year, will it? The same is true for your endermologie®
sessions. During the attack phase (2 sessions per week for 1 month), the goal is to send enough
messages to our slimming cells to create a sustainable cellular awakening. In a few weeks, depending on
your objectives, the technique will release resistant fat, smooth away cellulite, reshape curves or firm your
skin. After this intensive period, it is important to regularly continue to stimulate these cells so they don’t
fall back to their old, lethargic habits. The good news is that one session per month is sufficient to
reactivate this cellular memory and leverage its slimming and firming effects. Just like physical exercise,
endermologie® becomes a new lifestyle.</p>

      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>No, the treatment is very pleasant. The settings are customized depending on skin sensitivity. After the
first few minutes, you can feel a “cellular awakening” and the acceleration of blood circulation. The skin is
re-oxygenated and a feeling of well-being sets in. It is a unique sensory experience!</p>

      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>It all depends on your weight and your beauty objectives. Almost any diet can help you lose weight, but
not always where you want it. Orange-peel skin and localized fat in certain areas of the body
(saddlebags, buttocks or thighs) are immune to diets and exercise. To get rid of them, the endermologie®
technique has proven to be particularly effective. The ideal is to associate your endermologie® program
with a varied and balanced diet as well as regular physical exercise for optimal effectiveness.</p>

      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>Yes, endermologie® treatments stimulate circulatory exchanges to eliminate excess water while providing an immediate and lasting sensation of well-being.

WHAT CAN I DO?
</span><span class="icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>A little extra belly does not always mean excess fat. It could just be sagging skin and in this case, diets or ab exercises won’t help you. To effectively treat this area, the initial assessment is fundamental. What’s the test? Just gently pinch the skin fold. If the skin between your fingers is thin and the fold lacks substance, it’s a sagging skin problem. Other telltale signs include wrinkled skin, stretch marks or a frowning belly button. endermologie® uses specific maneuvers to stimulate the youth cells (fibroblasts) at the skin surface, making it firmer and more toned.</p>

      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>Some women consider liposuction as the last resort to get rid of their resistant fat. However, it has been scientifically proven that endermologie® is able to naturally release localized and resistant fat with the additional benefit of reshaping curves, eliminating cellulite and firming the skin. Painless and without any side effects, endermologie® also stands out as the solution of choice in cases where liposuction is not recommended (circulatory disorders, insufficient volume, etc.). However, if liposuction is done, it is strongly recommended to combine the two techniques to optimize results. Before the operation, the sessions prepare and soften the skin tissue to facilitate the surgery. After the operation and if recommended by your surgeon, they facilitate the resorption of edemas and hematomas and effectively improve skin quality. In any case, a comprehensive review should be carried out to determine the best approach to adopt.</p>

LPG stimulates circulatory exchanges to fight water retention and drain toxins, relaxes areas of muscle tension, eliminates stress and brings a deep sense of relaxation. Velasmooth is an anti-cellulite, fat-burning and skin-tightening treatment that targets the problematic body areas: thighs, buttocks, stomach, waist, etc. Combining these two treatments could bring a great whole-body experience for the balance of body and mind.

<p>45 minutes • 500 DKK</p>

Velasmooth combines Infrared and Radiofrequency (RF) energy technology with tissue mobilization and suction (pulsed vacuum). The synergy of these components ensures that depth of penetration beneath the skin layer is achieved for effective, controlled heating and claimed enhanced metabolism of fatty tissue. In fact, it is the first clinically proven medical device to penetrate deep enough into the fatty tissue to treat cellulite and non-invasively contour the body.
